These are the configurations for tmux and zsh (and others), that I'm using in my /home directories. This repo is for easy setup.

Before installing make sure you ran the following (install tmux zsh vim git and oh-my-zsh from source):

`$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install tmux vim zsh git`  
`$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`  

It contains the config for some plugins as well. Here is a list with the different GitHubs from where I get all the stuff:
